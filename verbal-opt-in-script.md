# Stacktact Verbal SMS Opt-in Script

VERBAL CONSENT SCRIPT: During voice calls, our AI agent says: 
"I can send you a text message with a link to view this conversation summary. This is completely optional and not required to use our service. Would you like me to send you this text message? You can say yes or no." 

If user says YES, the agent says: 
"Great! I'll send you one text message to [phone number]. You can reply STOP at any time to opt out. Standard message and data rates may apply."

If user says NO, the agent says: 
"No problem! You can still access your conversation summary by visiting our website."

CONSENT RECORDING: All calls are recorded. Verbal consent is logged with timestamp, phone number, and session ID. Recordings are stored for 90 days.

SMS is NEVER required to use our service. It is purely optional convenience feature.
